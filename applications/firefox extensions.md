Extensions I use / am evaluating

- au-revoir-utm - this strips the UTM_Source from urls
- Cookies Manager+ - edit / create cookies
- Disconnect - increases privacy
- DownThemAll - Easy way to download everything from a site (e.g. all PDFs, etc)
- Greasemonkey - Lets you run user scripts on pages
- Instapaper - I use to bookmark pages
- LastPass - for passwords
- Privacy Badger - blocks trackers
- Self-Destructing Cookies - can set cookies to be deleted when you close a page
- uBlock Origin - Blocks ads
- uMatrix - Blocks scripts / cookies etc on sites

Apart from au-revoir-utm which I can't seem to add, the rest are in [a collection](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/xoke/xoke/)
