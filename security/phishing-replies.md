# Phishing Replies

At work if anyone reports a phishing email, I receive it.  I like to put funny replies back to make them smile and make people more likely to report weird emails.  I don't mind if someone reports what they _thought_ was a weird email, but was just spam or similar, and not phishing.  Here are my replies - please feel free to use them yourself

All my emails follow the same outline:

_\[Name],_

_\[One of the options from below]_

Please continue to report any other phishing emails you receive and remember it is better to pause and think, than click and be wrong.
