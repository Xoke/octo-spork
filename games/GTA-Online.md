## Tips
(From https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNLoYOFs4wI)
1: Use the Interaction Menu (M on PC , Hold Down TouchPad on PS4 , Hold Back Button on XBOX)  to Spawn Personal Vehicle.
2: If You Ever Need To Travel Somewhere Far Away , Go To Any One Of The AirFields , Where Helicopters And Planes Spawn ( 2:09 ) .
3: "Teleportation" Is Also An Option For Fast Travel , Use the Interaction Menu ,(M on PC , Hold Down TouchPad on PS4 , Hold Back Button on XBOX), Set Your Spawn Location To Any Property You Own And Find A New Session.
4: If You Want To Steal A Parked Car On The Street , (which is most likely locked) , you can shoot the window to break it , and enter the car , it reduces the time to enter because, traditionally , you would have to break the window which would take you about 2-3 seconds more.
5: When You Get 3 Stars + Wanted Level , Helicopters Start To Spawn , The Easiest Way To Take Them Out Is To Shoot The Back Rotor Of The Helicopter Until It Spirals Out Of Control.
6: Super/Sports Cars Are A Waste Of Money As A Beginner , They Dont Serve You Much , Save Up For An Armoured Kuruma , which would make you almost bulletproof against NPCs or Players during missions. (Keyword: Bulletproof , they are not that good at taking missiles or bombs , but they are a worthwhile investment.)
7: First Two Guns Recommended For Beginners Are The Micro SMG because you can shoot them while in certain vehicles , the second gun is the the Special Carbine Rifle (+Extended Mag) , they have good firerate and damage overall.
8: Fastest way to heal is to eat snacks , you can stock up on snacks by buying them at the nearest convenience store , which costs around $2+ , which shouldnt affect you that much financially.
9: Go to the Diamond Casino to apin the Lucky Wheel every day and if you're lucky , you might win the Podium Vehicle , which is worth millions.
10: Fastest way to make money as a beginner is to do VIP Work , you can become a VIP if you have $50k , best missions you can do are HeadHunter missions and SightSeer missions.
11 : Do not waste your money on anything else that is not going to help you , instead , save up for businesses such as MC businessess like the cocaine lockup
12: Passive Businesses such as Bunkers , Nightclubs and MC Businesses will generate money for you in the background as long as they are stocked with supplies , and the money only generates while you're online , if you want to go afk and generate money , you can go to your apartment and watch TV , or go to your Nightclub and watch your DJ livestreams to avoid being kicked out for in-activity .

Source cars for money - grab _all_ the cars, but only _sell_ the high end (each one only spawns once until you have all of them).  This way after you have grabbed all low and mid tier cars, only high end ones will spawn
