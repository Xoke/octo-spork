# Minecraft

General setup:

* I like running [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/) for running different versions and extensions
* [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home) to make it a lot prettier!
  * Click the three dots, then Open Folder

* Copy that path, and after you download Optifine into the MODS subfolder
* In curseforge, add shaders (I'm currently using 'ComplementaryReimagined')
* Add any other mods
  * Xaero's Minimap / Xaero's World Map
  * Tree Harvester
  * Ore Harvester
  * Clumps
  * Appleskin
  * Autotools
  * Chunky
  * Dynamic Crosshair
* Other mods people have suggests
  * Infinite Trading
  * Jade
  * Just Potion Rings
  * Mouse Tweaks
  * Packed Up (Backpacks)
  * WorldEdit
  * Golden Apple Tree
* Then within minecraft set up optifine (enable it, and check performance settings)



I've also been testing out Prism

* Install sodium and iris shader mods, and then whichever shader which is a lot easier than optifine!
