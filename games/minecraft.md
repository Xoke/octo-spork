# Minecraft

General setup:

* I like running [curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/) for running different versions and extensions
* [Optifine](https://optifine.net/home) to make it a lot prettier!
  * Click the three dots, then Open Folder

* Copy that path, and after you download Optifine into the MODS subfolder
